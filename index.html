        <h2>MORNINGS WITH OLLIE</h2>

        <p>Love my mornings & early cuddles with Ollie!<br>He loves to look out the window and watch the cars go by.
            When big trucks go by he makes a grunting noise it’s so funny.<br><br>I love the mornings with Ollie. He’s
            extra cuddly when he first wakes up. He’s such a busier baby than Beckam was so I love the morning cuddles
            while he’s still waking up, especially while he drinks his bottle. We are supposed to start weaning him off
            the bottle and I’m not excited about it he never took a pacifier but he likes to suck on his empty bottle
            like a pacifier so I’m kinda nervous to cut it out.</p>
        <h2>THE LUXURY WINTER ACCESSORY THAT’S TRENDING NOW</h2>

        <p>No matter what you spend on your wardrobe, there are three pieces that can always elevate your look – shoes,
            handbags, and sunglasses. These are the things I invest in the most. The timeless pieces that will last for
            years. They make any outfit seem more high-end but also can make anyone feel more chic and put together.
            (Also just throwing this out there – between a good pair of sunglasses and a cute face mask, you’re pretty
            much guaranteed to look put together even when you’re not haha.) Sunglasses especially are my most-worn
            accessory year-round. Utah’s at a higher elevation so the sun is just as blinding in the winter as the
            summer (and it sometimes even worse when it’s reflecting off the snow). So I’ve learned to invest in
            high-quality sunglasses I love. Even if they are a splurge at first, I usually end up wearing them a ton so
            it comes out to a lower cost per wear than with other pieces I might only wear a handful of times.</p>
        <h2>Getting Tickets & Picking the Shows</h2>
        <img src="image/img6.jpeg" alt="Image is missing" height="400" />
        <p>If you're lucky or connected you can get an invite, sans the price tag. But I wasn't so lucky or connected my
            first 2 years so I'm here to help you out. First, plan out which shows are most important to you and make a
            schedule and this is a biggie: SET A BUDGET. If you're worrying about blowing your cash the whole time you
            won't have fun. Then check out prices, days, and times and prioritize the designers you want to see most.
            Lastly, purchase your tickets and get excited!</p>
        <h2>Dressing for The Shows</h2>
        <img src="image/img7.jpg" alt="Image is missing" />
        <p>Always be true to your own sense of style, if you don't you'll be uncomfortable the whole time and it will
            show. Remember, NYFW is about expressing yourself and taking in what the designers have chosen to express
            through their new lines. Also it's important to wear shoes you'll be comfortable in all day. Obviously you
            want to look good, but you'll be on your feet all day long, so be prepared.</p>

        <p>You can make any pair of jeans holiday-ready, just throw on a turtleneck, berry lip, and a luxe coat for a
            cozy chic outfit. This coat is amazing and comes in two colors and such a good price point.<br><br>If you
            like to dress up but keep comfy, think cozy knit sweater dresses. Not only does it bring a special occasion
            vibe, it’s also beyond comfortable (not to mention forgiving). Love the full sleeves on this one and it’s on
            sale right now under $30 right now and comes in 5 colors. Also love adding some scrunched socks with your
            fall dresses for a more relaxed feel – these have been my go-to lately.</p>

        <p>Last winter after Ollie was born and we were spending more time at home, we got in the habit of doing a new
            puzzle together as a family every month. The dropping temperatures have helped revive that tradition and it
            made me realize how much I missed having a puzzle out to work on with the kids. I told Mara to pick one out
            and they chose this Disney one. It has three different puzzle piece sizes – small, medium, and large – so
            it’s actually designed for everyone in the family to be able to enjoy together. We also got this Marvel
            Monopoly game that we broke in last weekend with Mara and Wes – such a fun twist on a classic fave!</p><br>
        <p>I have been dying to take Ollie to Disney for his first time (well he was in my belly the first time but that
            doesn’t really count ;). I ordered a few more Disney pieces to bring some of the magic home and create some
            of those early Disney moments until he can go in person. Honestly I think it will make his first visit to
            Disney even more special tying in all the memories from home. (Like these Mickey Mouse waffles for
            breakfast!)
